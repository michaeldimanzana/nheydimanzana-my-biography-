                        <h3>Effective Communication</h3>
                        <p>Effectively communicating ensures that you not only convey your message to someone but also let them know about your feelings and emotions. Whether it is amongst family members, friends, or office colleagues, effective communication helps 
                        individuals get through the tasks of life with ease.</p>
                        <h3>Organization and management</h3>
                        <p>Organisation helps in optimum utilisation of financial and human resources. It not only aids in the proper assignment of jobs to suitable employees but also keeps track that there is no waste of resources 
                        and efforts due to duplication of work.</p>
                        <h3>Negotiation</h3>
                        <p>Negotiation holds the key to getting ahead in the workplace, resolving conflicts, and creating value in contracts. When disputes arise in business and personal relationships, it's easy to avoid conflict in an 
                        effort to save the relationship.</p>
                        <h3>critical thinking</h3>
                        <p>Critical thinking helps people better understand themselves, their motivations and goals. When you can deduce information to find the most important parts and apply those to your life, you can change your situation and promote personal
                        growth and overall happiness.</p>
                        <h3>Teamwork</h3>
                        <p>Teamwork is important because it enables your team to share ideas and responsibilities, which helps reduce stress on everyone, allowing them to be meticulous and thorough when completing tasks. This will enable them to meet sales goals quickly.</p>
                        <h3>Delegation</h3>
                        <p>As a leader, delegating is important because you can't—and shouldn't—do everything yourself. Delegating empowers your team, builds trust, and assists with professional development.
                        And for leaders, it helps you learn how to identify who is best suited to tackle tasks or projects.</p>
                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>Research begins when we want to know something. Research is concerned with increasing our understanding. 
                        Research provides us with the information and knowledge needed for problem solving and making decisions.</p>
                       <h3>Confidence</h3>
                       <p>Confidence is important in business because it helps you to deal better with conflict, improves your communication skills, can make you happier at work, 
                           enables you to take feedback better, and it can make you a better manager or leader.</p>
                           <h3>Confidence</h3>
                           <p>Leadership is a vital management function that helps to direct an organization's resources for improved efficiency and the achievement of goals.
                               Effective leaders provide clarity of purpose, motivate and guide the organization to realize its mission</p>
